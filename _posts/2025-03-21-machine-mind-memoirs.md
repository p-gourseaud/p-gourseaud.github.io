# Is the Internet Dead? A Deep Dive Into AI-Generated Content

The internet is buzzing with content that seems to come from nowhere. Odd articles and blog posts that answer niche, seemingly random questions often leave us wondering: [*Was this written by a person, or just some faceless algorithm?*](https://aiotechnical.org/destroy-lonely-height/) This brings us to a provocative idea that’s been gaining traction online: **The Dead Internet Theory.**

According to this theory (explored here in [Wikipedia’s entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory)), much of the internet we browse today—blogs, forums, comment sections—is predominantly driven by bots, AI-powered tools, and large corporations using automated systems. Proponents suggest this trend has grown significantly over the past several years. If the conspiracy holds water, most of what we read might be automated fluff, designed to influence opinions, drive revenue, or simply fill the void of unlimited digital space.

But is the internet truly "dead"? And if so, can AI-generated content both exploit this dying ecosystem and prove profitable? Armed with a few bucks, a GPT-4 API, and some SEO tools, I set out to test whether it’s possible (or ethical) to build a website entirely fueled by AI content. What I learned was surprising—and often sobering.

## What Is the "Dead Internet Theory" and Why Does It Resonate?

The “Dead Internet Theory” explores the idea that human-driven content on the internet is vanishing beneath waves of algorithmically generated material. From AI spambots flooding forums to auto-generated marketing pages dominating search engines, the theory’s core question is this: *How much of the internet still represents authentic, human voices?* While the theory often veers toward conspiracy, it touches on undeniable truths.

One observable trend, for instance, is the growing sophistication of AI in generating content. Chatbots, language models, and content-writing software now blur the line between human-generated and machine-generated information. Search engine results are increasingly curated by ranking algorithms promoting specific formats—often those written with SEO and profitability in mind. This makes content like human stories, quirky perspectives, and niche expertise harder to find unless they cater perfectly to keyword optimization.

It got me thinking: *If so much of the digital world is already automated, why not dive in and participate? Why not see if AI can churn out content that’s both profitable and useful?* With the tools now readily available, I decided to run a small experiment.

## The Experiment: Can AI Power a Profitable Blog?

### Step 1: Choosing the Approach

To test the viability of an AI-driven blog, I decided to create content in a niche that is both low-competition and lightly searched—two qualities perfect for SEO optimization with minimal effort. Using [**Ahrefs Keyword Explorer**](https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer), I searched for topics related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer science. These themes kept the blog cohesive while also aligning with my own interests.

A longtail keyword stood out amid my search results: *"Is artificial intelligence capitalized?"* According to Ahrefs, this query had a keyword difficulty of only 1% but a monthly search volume of around 500. Other niche searches surfaced as well, such as [*"artificial intelligence in the Bible"*](https://machinemindmemoirs.com/posts/ai-in-the-bible/) and [*"quantum computing on AI"*](https://machinemindmemoirs.com/posts/quantum-computing-on-ai/)—questions rarely (if ever) answered by human writers. 

My hypothesis? Automating answers to niche, low-competition questions could drive steady search traffic with very low upfront investment.

### Step 2: Building the Website

I started by creating a [**static website using Hugo**](https://gohugo.io/), a simple framework that integrates smoothly with [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for free hosting. This allowed me to scale content quickly without extra costs for servers. To further streamline the process, I purchased a $10 custom domain name ["machinemindmemoirs.com"](https://machinemindmemoirs.com/). To populate the site, I then used [**GPT-4o-mini**](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/), a cost-effective version of OpenAI’s GPT-4 language model.

Each time I picked a query, GPT would generate a rough outline and then quickly produce a ~2,500-word article. For clarity and optimization, I also had AI summarize key information for Google snippets (the answers shown at the top of search results). Total cost per article for about ~3,000 tokens? A mere $0.002.  

For visuals, I experimented with **DALL-E 3** to create relevant images, paying $0.04 per image. While creating scam-free website visuals was more expensive than producing the article itself, this approach significantly enhanced the look, user immersion, and SEO performance of the site.

After one month, my AI-driven website hosted 28 articles optimized for low-competition keywords.

### Step 3: SEO, Traffic, and Monetization

I registered the site with [**Google Search Console**](https://search.google.com/search-console) to track impressions and clicks. Within the first 30 days, the site had appeared in Google search results 7,000 times and received 40 organic clicks—a disappointing number given my optimism.

To turbocharge impressions, I briefly experimented with [**Black Hat SEO techniques**](https://www.upwork.com/services/product/marketing-increase-domain-rating-dr-ahrefs-trust-flow-trustflow-tf-url-rating-ur-1724141677690454016) (i.e., acquiring low-quality backlinks from shady sources to boost domain authority) out of curiosity. Unsurprisingly, this gamble backfired. Google’s algorithms flagged the site and penalized it completely, sending traffic to zero and locking me out of monetization options like Google Ads, which deemed the content “insufficiently informative.”

The key takeaway? Google prioritizes content it deems valuable over hacks or tricks. If my experiment were to continue, I’d need better content—not shortcuts.

---

## The Results: Was the Experiment Useful or Profitable?

In short: neither. While the content cost almost nothing to produce, it failed to achieve meaningful engagement or utility. Here's why:

1. **Low-Value Content Generation**:  
   - Most queries I chose (e.g., *“artificial intelligence in the Bible”*) seemed too obscure or irrelevant to drive meaningful traffic.
   - Answers produced by AI were often generic and vague, lacking depth or originality. This turned away the few users who clicked through, harming user retention.

2. **SEO Challenges**:  
   - Despite targeting low-competition keywords, appearing in search results wasn’t enough. User intent wasn’t fully satisfied by algorithmically generated article drafts.
   - My failed experiment with Black Hat SEO only emphasized the importance of quality, ethical practices in sustainable growth.

3. **Profitability Constraints**:  
   - Even if click-through rates were higher, monetizing the site solely through impressions would have taken months—or years—to generate a meaningful return. Without alternative ad networks or better content, the endeavor made no financial sense.

Ultimately, the process of using AI to churn out low-cost articles raised a glaring question: *Do people even need this kind of content?*

## Bigger Implications: The Future of AI Content

Does my failure prove the "Dead Internet Theory"? Not quite. But it does add fuel to an uncomfortable possibility: **AI-generated content is fast outpacing human-driven material, but it’s not replacing its quality.** While automation enables near-zero-cost production, the key differentiator remains *value*.  

Human creators offer nuance, expertise, and storytelling that algorithms struggle to replicate. What my experiment demonstrates is the need for balance: technology has a place in content creation, but it’s up to us to decide whether AI enhances or trivializes the information ecosystem.

Is the internet truly "dead"? Maybe not yet. However, casually spamming it with AI-generated fluff might help kill the authenticity we're all craving.

---

## Final Thoughts

The internet’s future looks increasingly automated, and AI will undoubtedly play a pivotal role. But for those of us venturing into this new space, meaningful engagement and ethical responsibility should always trump mass production or quick monetization schemes.

Perhaps the real question isn’t whether we *can* flood the internet with AI content, but whether we *should*. After all, the health of the internet—and perhaps our trust in it—depends on the value we aim to create.

# The Dead Internet Theory

The [Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) is a conspiracy theory suggesting that much of the internet is now dominated by bots, AI-generated content, and algorithmically curated material rather than organic human activity. Proponents claim this shift, starting around 2016–2017, is part of a coordinated effort by governments, corporations, and tech platforms to manipulate public perception and behavior. The theory highlights issues like increasing bot traffic, search engine content limitations, and the growing prevalence of AI-generated media, which critics argue stem from observable trends but dispute the idea of a deliberate conspiracy.

# Machine Mind Memoirs

Since it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between content written by an artificial intelligence and that written by a human being, what if we added our own contribution to the "Dead Internet Theory"? Users pose billions of questions to Google, following a long-tail distribution: a small number of questions are asked very frequently, while a vast number of questions are asked very rarely. Perhaps we could automatically respond to these many infrequent questions for which users cannot find a dedicated article. A 2,500-word blog post would cost about $0.002 to produce using GPT-4o-mini for approximately 3,000 tokens. With a $2 revenue per thousand impressions (RPM), it could be profitable with just one view.  

## Search Data

We gather data on Google searches using the trial version of Ahrefs Keyword Explorer. This tool provides metrics for keywords, including their monthly search volumes and competition level. Our goal is to target keywords that are both highly searched and under-addressed, balancing search volume with competition. Our research is limited to topics related to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer science to maintain thematic consistency for our blog. Additionally, we filter searches by "informational" intent, as we cannot address "transactional" searches like "buy cheap graphics card." Among the targeted keywords is "is artificial intelligence capitalized," which has a ranking difficulty of only 1% and a monthly search volume of 500.

## Building a Website

To build a simple static website, we use Hugo, which allows us to host it for free on Cloudflare, ensuring high availability and simplified integration of new posts via Github Actions. We also purchase a domain name for $10 through Cloudflare.  

For every query we want to target, we use GPT-4o-mini to generate a response outline and then an article. A summary for the Google snippet is also generated. Additionally, we create a thematically relevant image using DALL-E 3 at a cost of $0.04. While this is significantly more expensive than the article itself, it becomes profitable after just 20 views and improves both the SEO and overall quality of the article. In this experiment, we generated 28 posts but could theoretically generate thousands more.  

## SEO Results

To appear in Google search results, we link our site to Google Search Console. In one month, our site appeared 7,000 times in search results and received a total of 40 clicks. To improve these results, I experimented with Black Hat SEO to obtain more referring domains. This, however, turned out to be a critical mistake, as the site was quickly banned by Google, and daily impressions plummeted. Furthermore, when applying for monetization via Google Ads, the request was denied, as the site was deemed, rightly so, to be insufficiently informative.  

# Conclusion

Is it profitable to generate a website using AI? Perhaps, if we had avoided Black Hat SEO, increased the number of posts, and explored alternative ad networks. Is it useful to generate a website using AI? We could not gather user feedback, but it was likely not useful: the queries we addressed were either strange ("artificial intelligence in the bible") or the responses we provided were too vague ("quantum computing on AI"). Since the endeavor was neither useful nor profitable, we will not take this proof-of-concept further.   -->
