As a **machine learning specialist**, I implement best development and MLOps practices to turn concepts into concrete solutions. With over **seven years of experience in data science**, I have particular **expertise in Big Data and NLP contexts**. My goal is to ensure that the value of proof of concepts (POCs) is fully realized and delivered to clients, from design to production.
